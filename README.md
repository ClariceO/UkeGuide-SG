# UkeGuide-SG
My First Website Proposal:

I was fond of the sound of ukuleles since young and when I found out that it was easy to learn, I bought a ukulele and searched up some songs to play. While using different ukulele websites I realized that they all have a rather complicated user interface (UI) which in a way made me uninterested to continue using their websites.

Furthermore, I have been playing the ukulele for a few years now and I learnt many things along the way. For example, ukuleles have different size and different ukuleles plays different sounds. Hence, I want new learners to be aware about it through my website and at the same time learn how to play the ukulele through my website.

This informative website is unique as it is going to have a store page featuring some recommended ukuleles from different brands and for different skill levels. This way businesses can showcase their ukuleles on my website and pay me a fraction of their profit made from their sales on the website. With that said my target audience would be people interested in learning about, buying and selling ukuleles.
